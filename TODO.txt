CONSTANT
--------

[ ] Add iterations & INF to CONSTANT force
[ ] Add trigger/repeat interval to CONSTANT force
[ ] Add delay to time widget
[ ] Add scale to duration slider widget
[ ] color the attack phase red, main phase green, fade phase blue


PERIODIC
--------

[ ] Add offset slider and spin box.
[ ] Make graph show the wave form.
[ ] Add box to select waveform and a phase-direction box.
[ ] add a period / frequency slider (log scale, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100)

SPRING
------

[ ] Axes ComboBox: X, Y, XY, Dir?
[ ] Trigger with button/interval.INF
[ ] 2 conditions?
[ ] Graph: Left.Red spring, Right.Green spring
[ ] Coefficient is size of the spring
[ ] Color saturation is saturation
[ ] Negative is left, positive is right
[ ] Symmetric box to sync left/right
[ ] Offset goes from -1 to 1
[ ] full deadband is 0..1 with 1 being full left to right
[ ] coeff can be negative (unstable spring)
[ ] Advanced graph is position.X vs. force.Y

DAMPER/FRICTION/INERTIA
-----------------------

[ ] Special 'simple' graphs, same advanced graph as spring.

MISC
----

[ ] Add calibration handling to GameController class
